    <!-- Question 1
    Hide and Show Elements
    Create a button and a paragraph of text.
    Set the paragraph’s display property to none so it’s hidden by default.
    Write CSS to change the display of the paragraph to block when the button is clicked, making it visible. -->

    Question 2 Inline vs. Block Elements Create three div elements and style
    them with different background colors. Set the first div to display: block,
    the second to display: inline, and the third to display: inline-block.
    Observe how each display value affects the positioning and behavior of the
    divs on the page.
