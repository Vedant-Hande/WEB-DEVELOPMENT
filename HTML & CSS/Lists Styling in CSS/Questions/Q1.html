    <!-- Question 1: Custom Bullet Points and Indentation
Create an unordered list with items like "Home," "About Us," "Services," and "Contact." Style this list to:

Use custom bullet points (like squares or circles) with a specific color.
Add some spacing between each list item.
Indent the list to make it look visually appealing.
Bonus: Add a hover effect to change the bullet color when the user hovers over each list item -->

    <ul>
      <li>Home</li>
      <li>About Us</li>
      <li>Services</li>
      <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
